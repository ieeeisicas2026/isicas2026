# BCMS Conference for Astro.js

This is an Astro.js starter kit for BCMS, a headless CMS. It's minimal but solid, with a clean codebase that hooks directly into your BCMS project, ready to extend and scale as needed.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can also run the Astro template easily using Wasmer (check out the [install guide](https://docs.wasmer.io/install)):

```bash
npm run build
wasmer run . -- --port 3000
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Wasmer Edge

The easiest way to deploy your Astro App is to use the [Wasmer Edge](https://wasmer.io/products/edge).

Live example: https://astro-wasmer-starter.wasmer.app/

First, you'll need to run `npm run build`, and then, to deploy to Wasmer Edge:

```bash
wasmer deploy
```

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
